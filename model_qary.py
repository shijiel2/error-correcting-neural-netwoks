            # The branch needs to take the feature map from 'outputs1' and continue processing.
            # This means the branch itself is a sequence of later ResNet stages + classifier.
            
            # This part is the most complex to translate directly due to Keras's functional model building
            # and layer indexing for the 'back' model.
            # A pragmatic PyTorch approach:
            # 1. Get feature map from shared front_resnet.
            # 2. Each branch has:
            #    - Potentially more ResNet blocks (if split early)
            #    - AvgPool
            #    - Flatten
            #    - Dense(32, relu)
            #    - Dense(q_out_features) (shared or individual)

            # For this translation, let's assume each branch has its own independent processing
            # from the shared feature map, consisting of AvgPool, Flatten, and Dense layers.
            # This simplifies greatly but deviates from the Keras resnet_v1_back if it added more conv layers.
            # The Keras code: outputs = conv_branch_resnet(...) -> y = model_back(x) -> x = Flatten()(x)
            # Then Dense(32), then Dense(q).
            # So, model_back itself must do the remaining convs, avgpool, flatten.

            # To truly replicate, resnet_v1_back_equivalent needs to be a ResNet fragment.
            # This is non-trivial.
            # As a placeholder for now, let's assume the split is late enough that
            # the branch only needs pooling and dense layers.
            # If split_layer_name is from layer3 (e.g. Act_2_X), then output is (batch, 64, H', W')
            # Then AvgPool, Flatten, Dense(32), Dense(q).
            
            # Let's assume the output of front_resnet.get_intermediate_output(x, self.split_layer_name)
            # is (batch, C_split, H_split, W_split)
            
            # The Keras `conv_branch_resnet` effectively creates the rest of the network from that point.
            # So, each branch needs its own "tail" which includes AvgPool, Flatten, Dense layers.
            # The `resnet_v1_back` in Keras would handle the remaining conv layers if the split was early.
            
            # For now, to make it runnable, let's assume a simplified branch:
            # It takes the feature map, applies AvgPool, Flatten, and two Dense layers.
            # The input size to AvgPool depends on H_split, W_split.
            # The input size to the first Dense depends on C_split.
            
            # This needs a more robust way to define the branch architecture based on split point.
            # For this exercise, I'll make a simplifying assumption that the branch
